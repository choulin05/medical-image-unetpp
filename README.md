# Brain MRI Segmentation with UNet++

This project focuses on brain tumor segmentation using MRI images with a deep learning model based on **UNet++**. The goal is to build a high-quality baseline system for medical image segmentation and provide a foundation for future research in **medical image analysis** and **AI for healthcare**.

---

## ✅ Project Goals
- Implement **UNet++** for medical image segmentation
- Train and evaluate model on **BraTS MRI dataset**
- Use **Dice Score** as evaluation metric
- Build a **clean and reproducible** research codebase
- Prepare for **future improvements** (Attention, Loss variations, UNet3+, etc.)
